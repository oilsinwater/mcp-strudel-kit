# 2. Problem Statement

## 2.1 Current State

Scientific researchers currently face significant barriers when developing research applications:

- Steep learning curves for modern web development stacks (React, TypeScript, build tools)
- Weeks of development time for basic scientific UIs with proper data integration
- Limited resources for hiring specialized full-stack developers
- Fragmented tooling across different scientific domains with no cohesive ecosystem
- Complex configuration management and deployment processes

## 2.2 Target Opportunity

Enable 100,000+ scientific researchers globally to create sophisticated research applications through natural language interaction with AI agents, democratizing access to modern UI development capabilities while maintaining professional development standards.
