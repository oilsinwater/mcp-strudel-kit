This PRD has been updated to align with the comprehensive architecture document. Key improvements include:

- **Technical Stack Consistency**: Vitest instead of Jest, explicit TypeScript 5.0+ requirements
- **Detailed Component Architecture**: Specific implementation details for all major components
- **Enhanced Security Model**: JWT middleware, comprehensive input validation, security headers
- **Performance Specifications**: Concrete metrics for response times, memory usage, concurrent operations
- **Development Experience Focus**: Hot reloading, auto-discovery, comprehensive error handling
- **Community Growth Strategy**: Plugin architecture, contribution guidelines, ecosystem development
- **Production Readiness**: Deployment strategies, monitoring, maintenance considerations
