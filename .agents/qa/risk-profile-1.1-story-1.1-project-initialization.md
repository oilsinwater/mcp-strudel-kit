#### 2.2. Learning Curve Risk
- **Risk**: Development team may need time to familiarize with xmcp framework
- **Probability**: High (4/5)
- **Impact**: Medium (3/5)
- **Risk Level**: 2.8
- **Mitigation**: Allocate time for initial exploration; create simple proof of concept first
- **Status**: Active
- **Owner**: Developer

#### 2.3. Environment Setup Risk
- **Risk**: Team members may have inconsistent development environments
- **Probability**: Medium (3/5)
- **Impact**: Medium (3/5)
- **Risk Level**: 2.1
- **Mitigation**: Provide detailed setup documentation; use Docker if needed
- **Status**: Active
- **Owner**: Developer

### 3. Quality Risks

#### 3.1. Foundation Defect Risk
- **Risk**: Defects in foundational setup will impact all subsequent development
- **Probability**: Medium (3/5)
- **Impact**: High (5/5)
- **Risk Level**: 3.6
- **Mitigation**: Thorough testing of all setup components; peer review of configuration files
- **Status**: Active
- **Owner**: QA

#### 3.2. Test Coverage Risk
- **Risk**: Insufficient test coverage of foundational components
- **Probability**: Medium (4/5)
- **Impact**: High (4/5)
- **Risk Level**: 3.5
- **Mitigation**: Define minimum test coverage requirements; implement test hooks during setup
- **Status**: Active
- **Owner**: QA

#### 3.3. Configuration Drift Risk
- **Risk**: Configuration files may diverge between development, test and production environments
- **Probability**: Medium (3/5)
- **Impact**: High (4/5)
- **Risk Level**: 3.0
- **Mitigation**: Use configuration management tools; environment-specific config validation
- **Status**: Active
- **Owner**: Developer

### 4. Dependency Risks

#### 4.1. Framework Instability Risk
- **Risk**: xmcp framework may be unstable or undergo breaking changes during development
- **Probability**: Medium (3/5)
- **Impact**: High (4/5)
- **Risk Level**: 2.8

- **Status**: Active
- **Owner**: Technical Lead

#### 4.2. Third-party Dependency Risk
- **Risk**: Critical dependencies may become unmaintained or have security vulnerabilities
- **Probability**: Medium (3/5)
- **Impact**: Medium (4/5)

(* = High Risk Items)

## Mitigation Priorities

1. **Critical (Red Light)**: 
   - Framework Compatibility Risk (1.1)
   - Foundation Defect Risk (3.1)
   - Test Coverage Risk (3.2)

2. **High (Yellow Light)**:
   - Path Resolution Risk (1.3)
   - Environment Setup Risk (2.3)
   - Configuration Drift Risk (3.3)

3. **Medium (Green Light)**:
   - Other risks can be monitored during implementation

## Escalation Criteria

- If Framework Compatibility Risk materializes, escalate to Technical Architecture team
- If schedule delays exceed 25% of initial estimate, escalate to Product Owner
- If any high-risk items develop additional complications, immediate notification required

## Residual Risk

Even with all mitigation strategies, some risk remains due to:
- Uncertainty with new xmcp framework integration
- Interdependency of foundational components
- Limited historical data for similar implementations in this context

**Residual Risk Level**: Medium to High
