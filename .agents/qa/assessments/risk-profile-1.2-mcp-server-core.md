# Risk Profile – Story 1.2: MCP Server Core Implementation

## Summary

Story 1.2 introduces the foundational MCP server runtime. It brings medium to high inherent risk due to protocol compliance requirements and runtime stability expectations. The risk profile below highlights key scenarios, their impacts on downstream stories, and mitigation/validation strategies.

| Risk ID | Area                    | Scenario                                                                                                              | Impact                                                  | Likelihood | Severity | Mitigation & Checks                                                                                                               |
| ------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| R1      | MCP Protocol Compliance | JSON-RPC 2.0 framing or MCP message schema deviates from spec, causing client incompatibility.                        | High – Downstream tool stories (1.3+) fail integration. | Medium     | High     | Leverage official MCP conformance suite; unit tests for request parsing/response formatting; contract tests with sample tool.     |
| R2      | Tool Execution Safety   | Tool execution context mishandles validation, allowing malformed inputs or leaking state.                             | High – Tool stories inherit unsafe runtime.             | Medium     | High     | Enforce Joi schema validation pre/post execution; add integration tests with bad input cases; document validation strategy.       |
| R3      | Graceful Shutdown       | In-flight requests lost during shutdown, resulting in data loss or corruption.                                        | Medium                                                  | Medium     | Medium   | Implement signal handling with awaitable drain; add integration test simulating SIGINT while tool is running.                     |
| R4      | Middleware Ordering     | Mis-ordered middleware (e.g., logging before validation) leads to missing observability or incorrect error responses. | Medium                                                  | Medium     | Medium   | Explicit middleware orchestrator tests verifying order; add contract tests for expected logging/error format.                     |
| R5      | Timeout Handling        | Long-running tools exceed timeout but continue executing, consuming resources.                                        | Medium                                                  | Medium     | Medium   | Use cancellable execution (AbortController); add integration tests with mocked slow tool verifying timeout path.                  |
| R6      | Configuration Drift     | Environment-based settings not applied consistently (dev vs prod), leading to runtime surprises.                      | Medium                                                  | Low        | Medium   | Centralize config loader; include configuration snapshot test ensuring defaults match story requirements.                         |
| R7      | Performance Under Load  | High concurrency saturates event loop, causing degraded response times.                                               | Medium                                                  | Low        | Medium   | Baseline load test with 50 concurrent requests; ensure logging instrumentation captures latency; schedule optimization follow-up. |

## Recommendations

1. **Compliance Guardrails** – Adopt (or build) a JSON-RPC compliance test suite and run within CI before code merges. Flag regressions quickly.
2. **Validation Library Contract Tests** – Create shared validation utilities for tools; ensure each tool implements pre/post validation as part of scaffold templates.
3. **Operational Playbooks** – Document configuration knobs (timeouts, rate limits, log levels) and recommended defaults to avoid drift.
4. **Profiling Hooks** – Enable optional performance instrumentation (e.g., histograms for response times) to surface hotspots early.
5. **Risk Review Gate** – After initial server implementation, conduct a focused QA session covering the above scenarios before allowing tool stories to proceed.

## Follow-Up Actions

- Schedule a deep-dive quality review after initial server MVP merges.
- Ensure DoD requires compliance tests and graceful shutdown validation before closeout.
- Align Story 1.3 (tool registry) tests to reuse the validation infrastructure created here, reducing duplicate risk.
