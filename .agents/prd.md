- **Scientific Data Libraries**: HDF5, NetCDF parsers, format specification adherence

### 11.2 Development Constraints

- **Backward Compatibility**: Must maintain compatibility with existing Strudel Kit projects
- **MCP Specification**: Cannot deviate from JSON-RPC 2.0 and MCP protocol standards
- **Open Source License**: MIT license requirements for commercial and academic use
- **Security Standards**: No telemetry without consent, responsible vulnerability disclosure
- **Performance Targets**: Must handle common scientific datasets without memory exhaustion

### 11.3 Community Constraints

- **Documentation Quality**: Every public API must have examples and clear explanations
- **Contribution Process**: Clear guidelines, responsive reviews, inclusive community standards
- **Support Commitment**: Responsive issue resolution, active community engagement
- **Accessibility**: Generated UIs must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards

## Appendix C: Architecture Alignment Notes

This PRD has been updated to align with the comprehensive architecture document. Key improvements include:

- **Technical Stack Consistency**: Vitest instead of Jest, explicit TypeScript 5.0+ requirements
- **Detailed Component Architecture**: Specific implementation details for all major components
- **Enhanced Security Model**: JWT middleware, comprehensive input validation, security headers
- **Performance Specifications**: Concrete metrics for response times, memory usage, concurrent operations
- **Development Experience Focus**: Hot reloading, auto-discovery, comprehensive error handling
- **Community Growth Strategy**: Plugin architecture, contribution guidelines, ecosystem development
- **Production Readiness**: Deployment strategies, monitoring, maintenance considerations
