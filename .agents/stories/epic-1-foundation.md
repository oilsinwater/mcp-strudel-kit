# Epic 1: Project Foundation & Core Infrastructure

**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Dependencies**: None
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Success Criteria**: Production-ready MCP server foundation with auto-discovery and basic tool execution

## Epic Description

Establish the foundational infrastructure for the Strudel Kit MCP Server, including project scaffolding, core MCP framework integration, tool auto-discovery system, and essential development infrastructure. This epic creates the base upon which all scientific tools will be built.

## Value Proposition

- Enables rapid development of subsequent epics through solid foundation
- Establishes development patterns and standards for the entire project
- Provides working MCP server that can be extended with tools
- Sets up quality assurance and deployment infrastructure

## Epic Goals

1. **MCP Server Foundation**: Working xmcp-based server with JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance
2. **Tool Auto-Discovery**: Automatic registration of tools from src/tools/ directory
3. **Development Infrastructure**: Testing, linting, and build systems
4. **Basic Security**: Input validation and error handling frameworks
5. **Documentation Foundation**: Developer setup and API documentation structure

## Stories in Epic

1. **Story 1.1**: Project Initialization and Scaffolding
2. **Story 1.2**: MCP Server Core Implementation
3. **Story 1.3**: Tool Registry and Auto-Discovery System
4. **Story 1.4**: Base Tool Class and Validation Framework
5. **Story 1.5**: Testing Infrastructure Setup
6. **Story 1.6**: Development Tooling and CI/CD Pipeline
7. **Story 1.7**: Basic Security and Error Handling
8. **Story 1.8**: Developer Documentation and API Standards

## Definition of Done

- [ ] MCP server responds to JSON-RPC 2.0 requests correctly
- [ ] Tool auto-discovery finds and registers tools automatically
- [ ] At least one sample tool works end-to-end
- [ ] Test suite runs with >80% coverage
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline deploys successfully
- [ ] Developer setup takes <5 minutes
- [ ] API documentation is auto-generated
- [ ] All code follows established patterns and standards

## Risk Mitigation

- **xmcp Framework Learning Curve**: Start with minimal implementation, expand gradually
- **Auto-Discovery Complexity**: Implement file-based discovery first, optimize later
- **Testing Setup Delays**: Use Vitest defaults, customize incrementally
- **Documentation Overhead**: Generate docs from code comments initially

## Dependencies for Next Epic

This epic must be completed before Epic 2 (Core Scientific Tools) can begin, as it provides:
- Base tool infrastructure for scientific tool implementation
- Validation framework for tool inputs/outputs
- Testing patterns for scientific tool validation
- Development workflow for rapid tool iteration
