    "express": "^4.x",
    "joi": "^17.x",
    "dotenv": "^16.x"

    "prettier": "^3.x",
    "husky": "^8.x",
    "lint-staged": "^13.x"
  }
}
```

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- [x] Package.json validation test
- [x] TypeScript compilation test
- [x] Import path resolution test

### Integration Tests

- [x] Development server startup test
- [x] Hot reload functionality test
- [x] Environment variable loading test

### Manual Testing

- [ ] Fresh clone and setup in <5 minutes
- [ ] All npm scripts execute without errors
- [ ] Code quality tools catch common issues

## Definition of Done

- [x] Complete project structure created
- [x] All configuration files properly set up
- [x] Dependencies installed and compatible
- [x] Development server starts without errors
- [x] Code quality tools integrated and working
- [x] Tests pass and coverage reporting works
- [x] Documentation updated with setup instructions
- [ ] Fresh environment setup verified (clean machine test)

## Risk Considerations

- **Version Compatibility**: Pin major versions to avoid breaking changes
- **Development Tool Complexity**: Start with minimal configuration, expand as needed
- **Path Resolution Issues**: Test import paths thoroughly across different environments

## Blockers/Dependencies

- None (foundational story)

## Estimated Effort

- **Setup Time**: 4-6 hours
- **Configuration**: 2-3 hours
- **Testing/Validation**: 2-3 hours
- **Documentation**: 1-2 hours

**Total**: 1-2 days

### Completion Notes

- Added Husky pre-commit hook to run lint-staged on staged files.
- Introduced dedicated TypeScript workspace/build configs for NodeNext resolution and updated npm scripts.
- Verified lint (`npm run lint`), type safety (`npm run typecheck`), build (`npm run build`), and tests (`npm run test`).

  - Restored typed MCP helper interfaces in test utilities
  - Replaced deprecated fs.rmdir with fs.rm in cleanup functions
  - Validated fixes with successful lint and test runs

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-06

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

**Summary**

- Project scaffold, tooling configuration, and automated validation suite all landed; lint and Vitest runs are green locally.
- Identified maintainability gaps in the shared test utilities that should be resolved before sign-off.

**Gate Decision**

- CONCERNS – regressions in `tests/setup/test-setup.ts` introduce deprecated filesystem usage and remove type safety in the shared helpers.

**Findings**

1. `tests/setup/test-setup.ts:49-53` – Uses deprecated `fs.rmdir(..., { recursive: true })`, which now emits Node deprecation warnings during `npm run test`. Replace with `fs.rm(dirPath, { recursive: true, force: true })` to keep the suite future-proof. (Severity: Medium, Suggested owner: dev)
2. `tests/setup/test-setup.ts:57-105` – Previous typed helpers were replaced with `any`-based functions, removing compile-time guarantees that the TypeScript scaffold is meant to enforce. Restoring typed interfaces (or equivalent generics) will align with the story’s “proper type checking” goal. (Severity: Medium, Suggested owner: dev)

**Acceptance Criteria Coverage**

- AC1 – Given the repo root, when inspecting `src/` and `tests/`, then the expected subdirectories (`core`, `middleware`, `tools`, `utils`, `integration`, `unit`, `e2e`) are present. (Manual inspection)
- AC2 – Given `package.json`, when running `tests/unit/package-config.test.ts:8-27` and `tests/e2e/dev-workflow.test.ts:8-23`, then required metadata, engines, dependencies, scripts, and lint-staged hooks are verified.
- AC3 – Given `tsconfig.json:3-35`, when executing `tests/unit/tsconfig-alias.test.ts:9-15` and `tests/unit/tsc-compilation.test.ts:8-66`, then strict mode, source maps, and path aliases compile without TypeScript diagnostics.
- AC4 – Given `.prettierrc:1-11`, `eslint.config.mjs:26-125`, and `.husky/pre-commit`, when running `npm run lint`, then tooling enforces Airbnb TypeScript + Prettier formatting.
- AC5 – Given `package.json:28-45`, `.vscode/launch.json`, and `.env`, when running `tests/integration/environment-loading.test.ts:8-34` and `tests/integration/server-startup.test.ts:1-8`, then the dev server bootstrap honors env loading and hot-reload readiness.

**Tests Reviewed**

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test`

**Recommendations**

- Refactor the shared test utilities to restore typed helpers and switch cleanup to `fs.rm`.
- Re-run lint/tests afterward to confirm the deprecation warning is gone.
- Optionally, tighten `tests/unit/tsc-compilation.test.ts` to include test files once the helpers regain type safety.

**Status Recommendation**

- Changes Required – Address the findings above before moving the story to Done.
