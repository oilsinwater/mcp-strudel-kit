# Executive Summary
summary: |
  The project initialization story (1.1) has not been completed.
  The basic project structure required by the acceptance criteria is missing.
  Critical components like src/ directory, TypeScript configuration, and development tools are not set up.

# Requirements Traceability
acceptance_criteria_status:
  AC1: # Project Structure Creation
    status: FAIL
    evidence: |
      - src/ directory does not exist
      - Core subdirectories (core/, tools/, middleware/, utils/) missing
      - tests/ directory exists but unit/, integration/, e2e/ subdirs missing proper structure
      - config/ directory exists but not properly configured per requirements
  AC2: # Package Configuration
    status: CONCERNS
    evidence: |
      - package.json exists but lacks proper configuration
      - Missing xmcp framework dependency
      - Missing TypeScript, Vitest, ESLint, Prettier as dependencies
      - Scripts for dev, build, test, lint commands missing
      - TypeScript 5.0+ and Node.js 18+ not specified in engines
  AC3: # TypeScript Configuration
    status: FAIL
    evidence: |
      - tsconfig.json does not exist
      - No TypeScript configuration with strict mode
      - Path aliases not configured
      - Source maps not enabled
  AC4: # Code Quality Tools
    status: FAIL
    evidence: |
      - ESLint configuration (.eslintrc.js) missing
      - Prettier configuration (.prettierrc) missing
      - Pre-commit hooks not set up
      - Current .gitignore has basic setup but needs expansion
  AC5: # Development Environment
    status: FAIL
    evidence: |
      - No development server script configured
      - Hot reload functionality not working
      - Environment variable loading not properly configured
      - No debug configuration for IDEs

# Risk Assessment
risk_rating: HIGH
risk_factors:
  - Missing foundational project structure
  - No TypeScript configuration for type safety
  - Lacking development tools for code quality
  - No proper build or test infrastructure
  - Blocks all subsequent stories in Epic 1

# Test Coverage Analysis
test_coverage:
  unit_tests: "0% - No unit tests implemented"
  integration_tests: "0% - No integration tests implemented"
  e2e_tests: "0% - No e2e tests implemented"
  coverage_evidence: "No test structure implemented according to story requirements"

# Quality Gate Rationale
rationale: |
  The project initialization story has not been implemented.
  The current project state lacks the basic structure, configurations,
  and dependencies required by the acceptance criteria.
  Without these foundational elements, subsequent stories cannot be properly implemented.
  The package.json has minimal configuration and the src directory doesn't exist.
  All major acceptance criteria are unmet.

# Required Actions
required_actions:
  - Create src/ directory structure with core/, tools/, middleware/, utils/ subdirectories
  - Create tests/ directory structure with unit/, integration/, e2e/ subdirectories
  - Configure package.json with required dependencies and scripts
  - Set up TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json) with strict mode
  - Configure ESLint and Prettier with appropriate rules
  - Set up pre-commit hooks using Husky
  - Implement development server script with hot reload
  - Ensure all acceptance criteria are met before re-review

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  - Complete the project initialization as a priority
  - Verify all file structures according to implementation details
  - Ensure all dependencies are properly installed and configured
  - Run all tests to verify functionality
  - Re-submit for quality gate review after implementation

# Definition of Done Verification
definition_of_done:
  all_criteria_met: false
  verification_notes: |
    - Project structure not created
    - Configuration files not properly set up
    - Dependencies not installed as required
    - Development server doesn't start (can't test)
    - Code quality tools not integrated (can't test)
    - Tests don't exist (can't verify)
    - Documentation not updated with setup instructions (can't verify)
    - Fresh environment setup not verified (can't verify)

# Final Decision
decision: |
  FAIL - The project initialization story is not ready for acceptance.
  Implementation must be completed according to all acceptance criteria
  before this story can pass the quality gate.
